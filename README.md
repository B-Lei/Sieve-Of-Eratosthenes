# Sieve-Of-Eratosthenes

What is it?
-----
A small web app that visualizes the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which finds all primes up to n. 

It was developed using Sinatra + Slim over the course of one night, with zero Ruby experience, as a personal challenge.

How do I use it?
-----
Enter an integer into the text field, then press 'Enter' or click the 'Go!' button. 

Disclaimer
-----
Because the web app displays a graphical representation of all numbers from 1 to n, it is **highly** recommended to use smaller integers for demonstration purposes. Large inputs may not be elegantly handled.
